Brickade is a multi-platform masonry photo grid for better UI/UX. It places elements in optimal position based on space availability. This effect leaves users with less loading time and more efficient user experience. 
<br>
<br>
In this project, [react-image-masonry NPM package](https://https://github.com/christikaes/react-image-masonry) was used to create a brick wall-like photo grid to display my favorite moments of trips I've experienced. <p>This project was bootstrapped with [create react app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Installation
you can download the NPM package using
`
npm install react-image-masonry --save--dev
`
