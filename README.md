Brickade is a multi-platform masonry photo grid for better UI/UX experience. In this project, react-masonry package was used to create a brick wall-like photo grid to display my favorite moments of trips I've experienced.
age.json` and running `npm install` in this folder should be enough, but itâ€™s good to consult the [changelog](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for potential breaking changes.
